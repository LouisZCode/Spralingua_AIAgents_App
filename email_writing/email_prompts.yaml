# Writing Email Exercise Prompts for German Course
#
# TWO-ATTEMPT PEDAGOGICAL APPROACH:
# 
# First Attempt: Educational hints only (no answers)
# - Students receive hints that guide them to self-correct
# - Example: "Check the adjective ending" NOT "Use 'das Beste'"
# - Forces active learning and problem-solving
#
# Second Attempt: Full corrections with explanations
# - Students see their text vs corrected version side-by-side
# - Detailed explanations for why corrections are needed
# - Comprehensive learning from seeing the complete solution
#
# This approach maximizes learning by encouraging self-discovery first,
# then providing complete guidance for deeper understanding.

# Evaluation prompt for first attempt (error identification)
evaluation_prompt_attempt1: |
  You are evaluating a German language learner's response. The student's level is {student_level}.
  
  Analyze the following text and identify errors:
  
  Original letter they're responding to:
  {original_letter}
  
  Student's response:
  {student_response}
  
  Identify errors in grammar, vocabulary, and spelling. Group errors by type and provide the actual text with EDUCATIONAL HINTS only.
  
  CRITICAL: For the hint field, provide ONLY hints that guide the student to discover the correction themselves. DO NOT give the answer or correction.
  
  HINT GUIDELINES:
  
  For GRAMMAR errors, use hints like:
  - "Check the case after this preposition"
  - "Review the adjective ending for neuter nouns"
  - "Consider the word order in this sentence"
  - "This verb needs a different auxiliary"
  - "Check if this noun needs an article"
  - "Review the verb conjugation for this person"
  
  For VOCABULARY errors, use hints like:
  - "Consider a more specific term here"
  - "This word is too informal for a letter"
  - "Think of a more appropriate expression"
  - "Avoid repeating the same word"
  - "This phrase sounds unnatural in German"
  - "Consider the cultural appropriateness"
  
  For SPELLING errors, use hints like:
  - "Check for an extra letter in this word"
  - "This word is missing a letter"
  - "Review the umlaut usage here"
  - "Check if this should be capitalized"
  - "This looks like a typo"
  - "Review the spelling of this word"
  
  Consider the student's level - be more forgiving for beginners.
  
  Return a JSON response with this structure:
  {
    "error_groups": {
      "grammar": [
        {
          "text": "<exact phrase with error>",
          "hint": "<educational hint only - NO ANSWERS>"
        }
      ],
      "vocabulary": [
        {
          "text": "<word or phrase that could be better>",
          "hint": "<educational hint only - NO ANSWERS>"
        }
      ],
      "spelling": [
        {
          "text": "<misspelled word>",
          "hint": "<educational hint only - NO ANSWERS>"
        }
      ]
    },
    "message": "Good effort! Here are some areas to review:",
    "general_feedback": "<one sentence of encouragement based on their level>"
  }
  
  For each category, only include if there are errors. Limit to maximum 3-4 errors per category, focusing on the most important ones.
  
  REMEMBER: Never reveal the correct answer in the hints. The goal is to guide students to self-correct.

# Evaluation prompt for second attempt (full feedback)
evaluation_prompt_attempt2: |
  You are providing detailed feedback on a German language learner's response. The student's level is {student_level}.
  
  Original letter they're responding to:
  {original_letter}
  
  Student's FIRST attempt:
  {first_attempt}
  
  Student's SECOND attempt:
  {second_attempt}
  
  Provide comprehensive feedback including:
  1. A corrected version of their text that PRESERVES their original message, ideas, and intent - only fix grammar, vocabulary, and spelling errors
  2. Explanations for the most important corrections
  3. Two focus points for future practice
  4. An overall score (0-100) based on their level
  
  CRITICAL: The corrected_text must:
  - Keep the student's original message and ideas
  - Maintain their writing style and personality
  - Only fix errors (grammar, spelling, vocabulary)
  - NOT add new content or rewrite their message
  - Preserve their sentence structure where possible
  - Make minimal changes necessary for correctness
  
  Return a JSON response with this structure:
  {
    "original_text": "<student's second attempt>",
    "corrected_text": "<fully corrected version>",
    "explanations": [
      {
        "error": "<what they wrote>",
        "correction": "<correct form>",
        "explanation": "<why this is correct>"
      }
    ],
    "focus_points": [
      "<specific grammar/vocabulary point to practice>",
      "<another point to focus on>"
    ],
    "score": <0-100>,
    "feedback": "<encouraging overall feedback message>",
    "improvements_from_first": "<brief note on what improved from attempt 1>"
  }
  
  Be encouraging but honest. Adjust expectations based on their level.
