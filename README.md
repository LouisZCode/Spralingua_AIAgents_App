## Development Guidelines

### Windows Compatibility
**CRITICAL**: Never use emoji characters in console output due to Windows encoding limitations. Use text markers instead:
- ‚úÖ ‚Üí [SUCCESS]
- ‚ùå ‚Üí [ERROR]
- ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚Üí [WARNING]

Emojis ARE allowed in HTML templates for user-facing UI.

### Database Models
All SQLAlchemy models must be imported in `app.py` after database initialization to establish proper relationships.

### CSS Architecture
- Two-layer system: `base.css` (global utilities) + component-specific styles
- Use CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Purple gradient branding: `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`

### Package Management
Always use UV for package management:
```bash
uv add package_name     # Add new dependency
uv sync                 # Install all dependencies
uv run python script.py # Run Python scripts
```

## API Endpoints

3. Use the established CSS design system
4. Test each component independently before integration
5. Follow the existing OOP architecture patterns

6. ## Why I Built This

7. After spending 4+ years as a Talent Partner recruiting for tech companies across the DACH region, I saw firsthand how language barriers limit career opportunities. Many talented professionals struggled to break into international markets simply because they lacked conversational confidence in German or English.

8. Traditional language learning apps focus on gamification and vocabulary drills, but what people actually need is **real conversation practice with immediate, intelligent feedback**. That's where AI shines‚Äîyou can practice speaking without fear of judgment, get instant corrections, and have conversations that adapt to your actual skill level.

9. Spralingua combines my understanding of what learners need (from recruiting internationally) with modern AI capabilities to create a tool that solves a real problem: helping people gain the language confidence they need to access better career opportunities.

10. ## Technical Challenges Solved

11. ### Multi-Agent Conversation Architecture
12. Built a sophisticated agent orchestration system using **LangGraph** where multiple AI personalities (Harry & Sally) maintain consistent character traits while adapting their language complexity to the user's CEFR level (A1-C2). Each agent has memory of past conversations and adjusts responses based on user progress.

13. ### Sub-Second Response Times
14. Achieved <2s response times for AI-generated feedback by implementing efficient prompt engineering, strategic caching, and optimized Claude API calls. This creates a natural conversation flow rather than the frustrating delays common in AI chat applications.

15. ### Privacy-First Voice AI
16. Integrated real-time voice input/output using Web Speech API and Minimax TTS, allowing users to practice pronunciation. Voice processing happens client-side where possible, minimizing data transmission and protecting user privacy.

17. ### Database-Driven Prompt System
18. Designed a flexible prompt management system stored in PostgreSQL that allows dynamic adjustment of difficulty levels, grammar rules, and cultural context without code changes. This makes it easy to add new languages and customize learning paths.

19. ### Production-Ready Deployment
20. Successfully deployed on Railway with Gunicorn, PostgreSQL, and proper environment configuration. Handles concurrent users with stateful conversation management across multiple workers.
